## description

***

This is an assignment to create a new portfolio using our new React skills, which will help set us apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.<br>
The work was envisioned through wireframe diagrams as a single-page application. It was completed by using REACT coding. Best viewed at full screen, 16:10 aspect ratio.<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer:
* WHEN I load the portfolio; THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.<br>
* WHEN I view the header; THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
* WHEN I view the navigation titles; THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
* WHEN I click on a navigation title; THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
* WHEN I load the portfolio the first time; THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default.
* WHEN I am presented with the About Me section; THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.

* WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section; THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
* WHEN I am presented with the Contact section; THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
* WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text; THEN I receive a notification that this field is required.
* WHEN I enter text into the email address field; THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.
* WHEN I am presented with the Resume section; THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
* WHEN I view the footer; THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
